# Visualization-of-Sorting-Techniques
This project focuses on the visualization of various sorting algorithms using the Cairo graphics library in C. The primary objective is to visually demonstrate how various sorting algorithms work by generating sequential bar graphs that depict the data transformation at each step.
The visual frames are saved as PNG images, which are then combined into a video using ffmpeg. This offers an intuitive, frame-by-frame view of the sorting process for educational or demonstrative purposes.
